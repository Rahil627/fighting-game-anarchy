come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/Bg86ZJ)  
if that's empty, you can read 'n contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy/wiki)

note to self: remember to open access to edit the wiki (under settings for this repo):
Settings, under the Features section, un-check 'Restrict editing to collaborators only'

should probably move to github pages, to make a simple fighting game database...
