### rathewolf's fighting game anarchy / aka the way of fighting games
is a digital anarchist diy community interested in the research and development of fighting games

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/FtAQws9)

if that's empty, you can read 'n contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy/wiki)

if that's not enough, you can halp me make [this site](https://rahil627.github.io/fighting-game-anarchy/)(!!), to which the wiki may be ported to soon. The site's source is in the docs folder; it's hosted and automatically built by GitHub Pages, and generated using Jekyll. Just ask for permission (git access permissions). Sooo much to do!! :) :) Halp find or make an awesome theme. Halp transform those lists into readable tables (csv vs flat-file database). Add your own cool art 'n animation! Do what you want.

#### notes

should probably [move to github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site), to make a simple fighting game database...

...wow, that was easy. Just a few clicks!

it seems [you can even publish to a custom domain?](https://hackernoon.com/use-custom-domain-with-github-pages-2-straightforward-steps-cf561eee244f)
  - holy shit, this is amazing!

[can even use any theme!!!](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)
